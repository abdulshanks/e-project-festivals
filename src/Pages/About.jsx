        <p>
          <span className="first-letter">F</span>ounded in 2009, MOONLIGHT
          EVENTS began as a small initiative by a group of cultural enthusiasts
          who believed in the power of festivals to unite communities and bridge
          cultural divides. What started as local celebrations in collaboration
          with municipalities has grown into a global movement.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span className="first-letter">O</span>ver the years, we have
          organized festivals across six continents, working hand-in-hand with
          local city associations, cultural organizations, and educational
          institutions. Our festivals serve as platforms for academic,
          professional, and cultural exchange, creating lasting bonds between
          communities worldwide.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span className="first-letter">T</span>oday, MOONLIGHT EVENTS stands
          as a testament to the belief that cultural understanding is the
          foundation of global peace. Through our festivals, we continue to
          discover and nurture talents, support creative endeavors, and spread
          information about the rich tapestry of human culture.
